#REASONS FOR OOP IN THE FIRST PLACE
# Python does not require to use objexts or classes
#complex programs are hard to keep organized
#objec-oriented programming organizes and structures code

#ourse pycharm for python developers or visual studio code

#comparison operator e.g <= >= > < == != e.t.c
### Arithmetic operations e.g // % * / + -
### logical operators e.g and or not
### identity operator e.g the test of two var e.g x is y, x is not y
### membership operator if a ver is a member of a collection e.g x in y, x not in y
### Bitwise operators
